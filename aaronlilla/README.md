# Aaron Lilla's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website, hosted on GitHub Pages! This portfolio showcases my skills as a front-end React developer, with projects that highlight my work in web development, responsive design, and dynamic user interfaces.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Route-Based Navigation**: Built with `react-router-dom` to allow for seamless route changes (e.g., `https://aaronlilla.github.io/about`). Routes update the `currentPage` in the Redux state, enabling navigation through the left-side dashboard menu and URL changes.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for screen sizes below 1150px:
  - Displays a condensed version of the logo and hides additional elements like social media icons and summary text.
  - Switches to a hamburger menu that opens a full-screen animated navigation.
  - Left column width adjusts to a streamlined 60px.
- **Morphing Background Animation**: Utilizes JavaScript for smooth transitions between background images.
- **EmailJS Integration**: Contact form powered by EmailJS for seamless email submissions.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The code is organized with best practices in mind, making use of modular components, Redux for state management, and `react-router-dom` for client-side routing. Below is a brief overview of the file structure:


## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **React**: Front-end framework used to build reusable components.
- **Redux**: Manages the global state, including the navigation state.
- **react-router-dom**: Enables dynamic, client-side routing for smooth navigation.
- **SCSS**: Styles the site with responsive design principles.
- **JavaScript**: Powers animations and dynamic content, including the morphing background effect.
- **EmailJS**: Configured for easy form submission in the contact section.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts the site and allows for public accessibility.
