        <p>
          <strong>With over six years of experience as a front-end developer</strong>,
          I specialize in creating responsive, interactive, and high-quality web and
          desktop applications using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Redux</strong>.
          My journey in tech includes key roles in pioneering projects, where I have
          consistently delivered robust, scalable solutions. I was a founding team
          member of TableCaptain V2, a sophisticated <strong>Electron</strong>-based app
          that transformed poker room management through real-time waitlists, dealer
          rotations, and synchronized TV displays. This state-of-the-art system, with
          <strong> WebSocket</strong> integration for real-time updates, established itself
          as an industry leader and stands as a testament to my commitment to innovation
          and usability.
        </p>
        <p>
          Beyond web applications, I have built <strong>desktop applications </strong>
          from the ground up with <strong>Electron</strong>, adding valuable features
          like auto-updating and custom hotfixes. I also emphasize effective data
          handling in my projects, working with <strong>GraphQL and Axios </strong>
          to manage complex data flows efficiently. Translating <strong>Figma </strong>
          designs into pixel-perfect, intuitive interfaces is another key strength,
          allowing me to bridge user needs and functional design with precision.
